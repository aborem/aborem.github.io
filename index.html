            Hi! I‚Äôm a final-year Computer Science PhD at UChicago researching
            privacy, advised by
            <a href="https://www.blaseur.com/">Blase Ur</a>. I've spent my time
            here designing, building, and evaluating consumer-facing privacy
            systems. Most recently, I worked with the

            >
            to build and publish a library for executing data
            transfer/portability requests (check out

          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also a full-stack software engineer and have worked at
            <strong>Asana</strong>, <strong>Lyft</strong>, and
            <strong>Bank of America</strong>.

                I'm graduating with my PhD in <strong>June of 2026</strong> and
                am looking to go back to industry, but am open-minded about what
                role I'd be taking on! Having said that, I'm interested in
                privacy engineering, product-focused software engineering, and
                research roles. If my research and experience sound like they
                could be a good fit, I'd be happy to chat.

          After developing a data annotation web-app, I ran a user study with
          online consumers from around the world. They explored their data using
          the tool I built and noted things they found surprising or creepy.
          They were often overwhelmed and confused, but felt more trust toward
          the platforms the more transparency they were given. Watch

          built a taxonomy listing every feature and affordance and which

          them about the process. Many of them were dissatisfied and found the

          Built taxonomy for ways privacy extensions break websites by analyzing

          react when this happened to them. Based on this info, we are working

          I was born and raised in Belo Horizonte (Brazil) and moved to the U.S.
          during my junior year of high school! I then went to
          <strong>Brown University</strong> where I graduated with a B.S. in
          Computer Science. While there, I was involved in research projects
          with <a href="https://www.senykamara.com/">Seny Kamara</a> (applied
          cryptography),
          <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/pklein/">Phil Klein</a> (fair
          census redistricting), and

          internships at

            >Bank of America Merrill Lynch</a
