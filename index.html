        I'm a first year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Chicago where I work in 
        <a href="https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/" target="blank">SUPERGroup</a> and am
        advised by <a href="https://www.blaseur.com/" target="blank">Blase Ur</a>. 
        I'm interested in usable/mobile/web privacy and security, HCI, and education with a focus on issues of power and harm.

        Before that, I worked at <a href="https://asana.com" target="blank">Asana</a> as a product engineer for a year.
        I graduated from
        <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/" target="blank">Brown University</a> in
        May 2020, where I studied Computer Science. I worked as a Teaching
        Assistant for a few courses (<a

        <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0180/">CS18</a>. I also

        During my senior year at Brown I worked on a research study with
        <a href="https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/about/people/staff/christina-smith" target="blank">Christina Smith</a>
        to explore the experience of STEM Teaching Assistants at Brown and
        craft new institution-wide guidelines for these student workers. I also worked with
        <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/" target="blank">Jeff Huang</a>, from the
        <a href="https://hci.brown.edu/" target="blank">Brown HCI group</a>, on developing and studying tools for
        <a href="https://selfe.cs.brown.edu/" target="blank">self-run experiments</a>
        and with
        <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~seny/" target="blank">Seny Kamara</a>, from the
        <a href="http://esl.cs.brown.edu/" target="blank">Encrypted Systems Lab</a>, on
        <a href="https://github.com/aborem/protestmix" target="blank">ProtestMix</a>, a prototype Android app that uses
        SMS forwarding and phone swapping to partially anonymize
        protest attendees in their mobile communication.
